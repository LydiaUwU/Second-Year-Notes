All lectures will be recorded.

## Overview
This module is about the design of processors that can handle some degree of assembly.
Will be using a hardware description language to simulate a processor.

- Implementing registers.
- Implementing microoperations (addition, shifting, etc.).
- Sequencing microoperations.
- Implementing control.

## Fixed vs Programmable Instructions
Fixed in are better for system resources but are less flexible.
Example CPU vs GPU

## Von Neumann Architecture
This design was first specified by John von Newmann in 1940.

## Exam
Just assignments, no exam.

90% for project and an additional 10% for meeting the deadlines through the course.
Repeats will be an exam.

Questions will see to establish that you have a good grasp of the following concepts:
- Microoperations
- Datapath
- Busses
- Alu/Shit design
- Status bit generation and use
- Control unit design and operation.

2 Weeks to complete this, due at the end of reading week.
