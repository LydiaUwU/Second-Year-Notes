# Synthesis

- Synthesis produces a digital circuit that implements the behaviour captured in the VHDL description.
- VHDL is also the bases for a simulation.
- Characteristics of digital systems:
  - Structural.
  - Behavioural.
  - Physical.

## Event, Propagation Delays and Concurrency
**Event:** When an input signal changes.
**Propagation Delays:** A delay between events.
**Concurrency:** When multiple events occur at a time.
