# Information System Design Considerations

## Perspectives and Ambiguity
Don't intend for your diagram to a rigid plan, use it to facilitate discussion within the project.

UML Diagrams provide a mechanism to display, discuss, negotiate and record perspectives.

## Changing Contexts
Consider the context, or potential change in context of the situation when you design a system. It's okay to say that the scope of your system is limited to a current context as long as you put consideration into it.

## Constraints
**Cost, Scope and Time**

## Scope Creep
Avoid falling into scope creep. Take time to regularly reflect on your scope while working.
