In the future when doing project work it might be worthwhile to look into ADAPT Science Foundation.

In this module we will be using UML to deal with the data from users.

## How this module will operate
1. Course Content in video and slide format will be uploaded each Thursday onto Blackboard.
2. An email will be sent out each Thursday to wrap up the week and to highlight what is to come the following week.
3. On a regular week, each student is required to attend a one hour online session with lecturer and TAs.
  1. Work in small groups on a task.
  2. You will also get a chance to work on and get feedback on your assignment.
