# Class Diagrams
Describe, in a visual form, the static structure of a system at a certain level of abstraction.

Class Diagrams **do not** show the functional requirements of a system.
Class Diagrams **do not** show how classes interact at run time.

## Objects and Classes
We categorise *objects* into *classes*. We say that objects are instances of classes.

## Attributes
A named property of a class that describes a range of values that instances of the property may hold.

## Derived Attributes
Used to specify attributes whos value is the result of a computation, based on other attribute values.

## Operation
The implementation of a service that you can request on any object of the class.

A class may have any number of operation or no operation at all.

## Describing Relationships
Express the relationships between the problem domain classes using associations.

## Class Association
A stronger form of associate where there's some notion of objects of one class being made up of those of another.

Known as "Aggregation by Reference".
