# Introduction to XML

**XML:** e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage

## What is Markup
**Markup:** Is a sequence of characters within a text or word processing file to define:
- Print Properties
- Display Properties
- Document's Logical Structure

Markup indicatiors are often called "tags".

## What is SGML
**SGML:** **S**tandard **G**eneralised **M**arkup **L**anguage

*Meta-language* for defining document markup vocabularies. Uses logical markup (structure, content) and not physical markup (how the document looks on the printed page).

Platform, system, vendor and version independent documents.

Very powerful, but contains a number of complex features.

HTML is an SGML vocabulary.

## What is HTML
HTML is the de facto standard for publishing web content. Supporting full SGML on the web was too difficult so HTML made some simplifications:
- Not extensible
- Limited structure
- Not content oriented
- Cannot be validated

HTML is a simple language to understand and use.

## What is XML
Uses user-defined tags.

XML is a simplified subset of SGML.

Can also be used to define document markup vocabularies (e.g. XHTML), these can have a strictly defined structure (DTD).

Retains the powerful features of SGML (extensibility, structure, validation).

Separates structure and presentation.

## Why is the Emergence of XML an Important Development?

XML is a tool for defining vocabularies.
- XML vocabularies are easy to read.
- XML is self describing.

XML vocabularies are easy for computers to process, exchange and display.
- XML tools are ubiquitous, free and conform to established standards.
- Natural affinity with object serialisation.
- Data source neutral.
