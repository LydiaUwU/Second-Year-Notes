# Ethics in Technology Innovation

**This lecture is riddled with issues and I strongly recommend doing your own readings about business, technology and morality.**

## Why Should Tech Innovators be Concerned with Ethics
New technologies have a profound impact on the way we live, the relationships we have and on the societal and political processes we engage in.

- First: It is good for the image of your business (instrumental goal).
- Second: It actually improves the service you provide (substantive goal).
- Third: Because it is the *good* this to do, it contributes to your idea of a better society and being a "good" person (normative goal).

## Dominant Views in Technology Ethics
### The Neutrality Thesis
Technologies are instruments that we can use to attain our goals.
> People kill people.

### The Determinism Thesis
Technologies dictate everything we do, they determine who we are.
> Guns kill people.

### The Co-Shaping Thesis
Technologies and humans together "construct" our social world.
> Gun-people kill people.

## AI Ethics - Where Next?
Many countries, companies and transnational bodies working on principles and guidelines.
Some are taking a wait-and-see approach, but the EU leading with recent white paper.

AI industry has failed to form self-regulation. (*No shit lmfao*)

## Challenges to Tech regulation
- **Pacing:** AI tech and applications develop faster than societies ability to regulate it.
- **Securitisation:** International competition as AI perceived as a strategic economic/military resource.
- **Innovation:** Perceived as impediment to AI-based innovation and its economic and social benefits.
- **Asymmetry:** Power of AI concentrated in a few digital platforms that benefit from massive network effects.

## Practicing Ethics in Responsible Research and Innovation
- **Disclosure:** Exploration and identification of ethical impacts.
- **Theoretical:** Frameworks to evaluate the impacts.
- **Application:** Moral deliberation to overcome negative impacts.

*Discloser level* neglected in current methodologies, as it needs to:
- Keep pace with volume and speed of innovation.
- Accessible to non-ethicist.
- Enabling a collaborative process.

## Ethics Canvas
**Ethics Canvas:** A methodology for identifying, evaluating and resolving ethical impacts during R&I stages.

Transform affordances of popular *Business Model Canvas* into an Ethics Canvas.

Collaborative brainstorming tool with two aims:
- Help teams identify, discuss and articulate possible ethical impacts.
- Bring about pivots in the design.

## Considerations on Ethical Impacts of Technology
- Changes in individual behaviour.
- Relationships between individuals.
- Relationships between groups with representation.
- Relationships between individuals and collectives.
- Impact in the public sphere, conflicts, our worldviews, etc.
- Impact of technology failure.
- Impacts on resources, including the environment.
