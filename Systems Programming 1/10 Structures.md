# Structures
Structures are C's way of grouping collections of data into a single manageable unit.
- This is also the fundamental element of C upon which most C++ is built.
- Similar to Java's classes.

You can use a `typedef` if you don't like having to use the word `struct` every time.

Access structure variables by the dot operator.

You can assign structures as a unity with `=`. This is difference from Java where variables are simply references to objects.
