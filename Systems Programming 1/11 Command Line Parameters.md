# Command Line Parameters

Often a user wants to pass parameters into the program from the UNIC prompt. This is accomplished in C using `argc` and `argv`.

`argc` is the number of parameters, which includes the name of the program.

`argv` is and array of the parameters. `argv[0]` is the name of the program.
