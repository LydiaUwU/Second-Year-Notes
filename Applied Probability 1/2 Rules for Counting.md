# Rules for Counting

**Product Rule:** Let the sets `A_1, ..., A_k` contain, respectively, `n_1, ..., n_k elements`, The number of ways of choosing one element from `A_1`, one element from `A_2`, ..., one element from `A_k` is `n_1 n_2 ... n_k`.

**Factorial:** To further discuss counting, we need to know the factoral. For a positive integer `n` the factorial of `n` is denoted as `n!` and it is defined as follows:

``n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2)...(2)(1)``

One factorial is `1` according to the definition, and `0` factorial is defined as `1`

**Permutation:** An ordered sequence of `k` objects from a set of `n` distinct objects.

**Combination:** Any unordered subset of `k` objects from a set of `n` distinct objects.
