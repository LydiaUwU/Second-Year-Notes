# Generic Types

## Parameterised Stack
We can write this Stack to work on objects, instead of any one specific type. This removes the need for lots of duplicate code. But this is still prone to casting errors.

### Parametric Polymorphism
By using Java's generics we can avoid casting in client and we can discover type mismatch errors at compile time instead of run time.

## Generic Iterators
*Couldn't find any decent notes to take on this, will check the slides later*

## Generic Comparisons
Use `x.compareTo(y)` to compare generic items.
