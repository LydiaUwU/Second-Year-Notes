# Doubly Linked Lists

Using the List library (`java.util.List`).

## Moral of the Story
### Before you implement an operation on a complex Data Structure
- For each meaningful state your DS may be in:
  - For each different meaningful input to your DS operation:
    - Create one example on paper.
    - Work out the example on paper.
    - Reuse code from previous, simpler examples.
    - Group cases whose examples require the same steps.
- **Only then write code.**
