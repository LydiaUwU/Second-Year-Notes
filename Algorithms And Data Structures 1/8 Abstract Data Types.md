# Abstract Data Types

**Data Type:** A set of values and a set of operations on those values.

**Abstract Data Type:** A *data type* whose implementation is unknown to the client of the ADT.

**Application Programming Interface (API):** A list and informal description of the operations of an ADT.

## Client, Implementation, Interface
Separate interface and implementation.

### Benefits
- Clients can't know the details of implementation.
- Implementation can't know details of client needs, many clients can reuse the same implementation.
- Creates modular, reusable code.
- Use optimised implementation where it matters.
