# Review of Propositional Logic

**Proposition:** Is any declarative sentence that is either true or false.

## Connectives
- `∧` And
- `∨` Or
- `¬` Not
- `→` Implies (*If/Then*)
- `↔` Equivalence (*If and Only If*)

The only instance when an implication, denoted by `P → Q`, is false when the hypothesis (`P`) is true, but the conclusion (`Q`) is false.

The truth table for equivalence says that both `P` and `Q` must have the same truth.

**Priority of the Connectives (Highest to Lowest):** `¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔`

## Tautologies
**Tautologies:** Are statements that are always true, regardless of the truth values of the variables involved.

We can use just NOT and OR to represent all of `¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔`.

One connective called the Sheffer Stroke (`|`, *NAND*) can be used to represent all of `¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔`.

If `P → Q` is a given implication, `Q → P` is its **converse** while `¬P → ¬Q` is its **contrapositve**.
