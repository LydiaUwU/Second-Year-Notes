# Predicate Logic and Quantifiers

**Predicate Logic:** Propositions depend on variables, so their truth value may change depending on which values these variables assume.

## Quantifiers
**Existential Quantifier:** Denoted `∃`. There exists. `∃xP(x)` is true if `P(x)` is true for some value of `x`, it is otherwise false.

**Universal Quantifier:** Denoted `∀`. For all. `∀xP(x)` is true if `P(x)` is true for all allowable values of `x`, it is otherwise false.

**Uniqueness Quantifier:** Denoted `∃!`. There exists only one. `∃!xP(x)` is true if `P(x)` is true for exactly one value of `x`, it is otherwise false.

## Alternation of Quantifiers
The order of quantifiers cannot be exchanged as it might modify the truth value of the statement.
