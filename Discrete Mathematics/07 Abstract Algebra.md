## Binary Operations
**Binary Operation:** Let `A` be a set. A *binary operation* on `A` is an operation applied to any two elements `x, y` that are elements of `A` that yields element `x * y` in `A`.

## Semigroups
**Semigroup:** A *semigroup* is a set endowed with an associative binary operation. We denote the semigroup with `(A,*)`.

## Identity Elements
**Identity Elements:** Let `(A, *)` be a semigroup. An element `e` of `A` is called an identity element for the binary operation `*` if `e * x = x * e = x` for all of `A`.

## Monoids
**Monoid:** A *monoid* is a set `A` endowed with an associative binary operation `*` that has an identity element `e`. In other words, a monoid is a semigroup `(A, *)`, where `*` has an identity element `e`.

## Inverses
**Inverse:** Let `(A, *)` be a monoid with identity element `e` and let `x` be an element of `A`. An element `y` of `A` is called the inverse of `x` if `x * y = y * x = e`. If `x` has an inverse it is called **invertible**.

## Groups
**Group:** A group is a monoid in which every element is invertible.

## Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms
**Homomorphism:** Let `(A, *)` and `(B, *)` both be semigroups, monoids or groups. A function `f : A -> B` is called a homomorphism if it respects the binary operation.

**Isomorphism:** Let `(A, *)` and `(B, *)` both be semigroups, monoids or groups. A function `f : A -> B` is called an isomorphism if it is bijective and a homomorphism.
