# Functions

**Function:** Let `A, B` be sets. A function `f : A -> B` is a rule that assigns to every element of `A` one and only one element of `B`. `A` is called the **domain** of `f` and `B` is called the **codomain**.

**Range:** Let `A, B` be sets, and let `f : A -> B` be a function. The *range* of `f` is denoted by `f(A)` is the subset of `B` defined by `f(A) = {y ∈ B | ∃ x ∈ A s.t. f(x) = y}`.

**Boolean Function:** Let `A` be a set. A *Boolean function* on `A` is a function `f : A -> {T, F}`, which has `A` as its domain and the set of truth values `{T, F}` as its codomain. `f : A -> {T, F}` thus assigns truth values to the elements of `A`.

## Inverting Functions
In order for a function `f` to have an inverse it needs to be to be both injective and surjective.

**Injective:** A function `f : A -> B` is called *injective* or an *injection* if `f(x) = f(y) => x = y`.

**Surjective:** A function `f : A -> B` is called *surjective* or a *surjection* if `∀z ∈ B  ∃x ∈ A s.t. f(x) = z`

## Functions Defined on Finite Sets
This was a collection of proofs.

## Functions Defined on Infinite Sets
This was also a collection of proofs. Hilbert's Hotel is pretty neat.
