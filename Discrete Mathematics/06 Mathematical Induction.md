# Mathematical Induction

## Mathematical Induction Consists of Two Steps
**Step 1:** Prove statement `P(1)` called _the base case_.
**Step 2:** For any `n`, assume `P(n)` and prove `P(n+1)`. this is called _the inductive step_.
**Remark:** Step 2 is not just an implication but infinitely many!

**Strong Induction:** For some arguments by induction, it might be necessary to assume not just `P(n)` but also `P(1), P(2) ... P(n-1)`.
